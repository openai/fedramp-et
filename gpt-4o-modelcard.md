model_id: gpt-4o
model_description: |
    GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model, which accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It’s trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. 

    GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in a conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models.
    In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we shared a public system card available at https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card which includes our evaluations. 

    Our system card provides a detailed look at GPT-4o’s capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, with a focus on speech-to-speech (voice) while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and the measures we’ve taken to enhance safety and alignment. We also include third party assessments on general autonomous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o text and vision capabilities.

    The scope of this system card is narrower than the potential scope of abilities GPT-4o can be used to unlock; notably, both custom fine-tuning and image capabilities are explicitly out of scope. In addition, this system card builds on previous cards (GPT-4, GPT-4v) that should be consulted in addition to the public GPT 4o system card which contains more details and a full evaluation of GPT 4o against our Preparedness Framework (https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf).
